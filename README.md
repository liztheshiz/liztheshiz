### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Liz.

I'm a junior web dev, always open to new projects and learning opportunities.

Currently working on general improvements to my existing projects, and planning my next web app, which will center around mental health.

Also seeking job opportunities for junior frontend developers!
